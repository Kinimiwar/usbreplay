Work-in-progress parser for processing USBTrace XML logs. The Python script
parses the XML and generates a simple easily-parseable text file describing
what happened on the USB bus (i.e, which endpoints were read from or written
to, and with what data). The C program just parses that text file and
constructs data structures appropriate for integration with libusb to replay
the messages grabbed by USBTrace. No libusb integration yet though - it just
prints the data in a slightly different format.

The project build assumes a directory structure like this:

src
|
+-apps
| |
| +-replay
|
+-libs
