Work-in-progress parser for processing USBTrace XML logs. The Python script
parses the XML and generates a simple easily-parseable text file describing
what happened on the USB bus (i.e, which endpoints were read from or written
to, and with what data). The C program just parses that text file and
constructs data structures appropriate for integration with libusb to replay
the messages grabbed by USBTrace. No libusb integration yet though - it just
prints the data in a slightly different format.

The project builds using the MakeStuff build infrastructure, like this:

mkdir $HOME/20161106
cd $HOME/20161106
wget -qO- http://tiny.cc/msbil | tar zxf -
cd makestuff/apps
../scripts/msget.sh makestuff/usbreplay/20161106
cd usbreplay
make deps
